The purpose of the Capstone Project is for second-year MDSH students to apply theoretical knowledge acquired during the Master of Health Data Science (MDSH) program to a project involving actual biomedical, public health, or business data in a realistic setting. Students form teams of 5 or 6 and collaborate with a partner organization to solve a business or healthcare question identified by the partner.
