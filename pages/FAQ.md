### Application and Admissions

**Q**: What is the application fee for this program?\
**A**: The standard UCLA graduate program application fee is $135 for U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents, or $155 for other applicants.

**Q**: Do I need to have a computer science / data science background to apply?\
**A**: No.  Strong applicants will have a background in STEM, including biological and health sciences. 

**Q**: I submitted my application.  When will I find out whether I have been admitted?\
**A**: Applications are actively being reviewed on a rolling basis. The length of time it will take to release the admissions decision will depend on several factors, including the completeness of the application (transcripts, TOEFL/IELTS scores, Letter of Recommendation, etc.)  

**Q**: Where do I submit my official transcripts after I've been accepted?\
**A**: Official transcripts must be sent directly by your institution to **admissions@ph.ucla.edu** or to the following address:\
*<center>UCLA Fielding School of Public Health</center>*
*<center>c/o Michelle Garcia</center>*
*<center>650 Charles E. Young Drive S., Room 16-068</center>*
*<center>Los Angeles, CA 90095</center>*

**Q**: I was rejected by the MDSH program, am I able to request feedback regarding my application?\
**A**: We acknowledge the effort required to submit an application to our program and thank each applicant for their attention to creating a high-quality submission. Due to the volume of applications, we do not provide individual feedback on the quality of applicants nor provide suggestions on how to strengthen future applications. We do, however, encourage you to strengthen your application and apply again in the future.

**Q**: What is the admission rate of the MDSH program?\
**A**: Program statistics, including admission rate, are published by [UCLA Graduate Division](https://grad.ucla.edu/programs/school-of-public-health/biostatistics-department/data-science-in-health/).

### International Students: Visas and Admissions

**Q**: What type of Visa can international students receive? \
**A**: Graduate students taking at least 8 credit hours, equivalent of 2 MDSH courses, in Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters are considered full-time for F1 visa reporting purposes. 

**Q**: I am an international student. Can I be exempt from the TOEFL/IELTS requirement if my university's classes are all in English?\
**A**: Starting with applications for the fall 2026 admission, if you have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher from an accredited university located in the United States or in another country where English is the **sole** language of instruction according to the [World Higher Education Database (WHED)](https://whed.net/home.php), you are exempt from submitting English proficiency test scores to meet the English language proficiency requirement for admission to UCLA. For example, [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.whed.net/institutions/IAU-026638), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.whed.net/institutions/IAU-021593), and [Wenzhou-Kean University](https://www.whed.net/institutions/IAU-026588) are exempt, but [Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.whed.net/institutions/IAU-026636), Duke Kunshan University, and University of Nottingham Ningbo China are not exempt. Please refer to the [UCLA Graduate Division's English Requirements](https://grad.ucla.edu/admissions/english-requirements/) for the most current information. 

**Q**: How can I make sure UCLA receives my official TOEFL/IELTS score?\
**A**: Official TOEFL score reports are sent electronically upon your request from ETS to UCLA (institution code 4837, department code 99). Official scores are required for admission but not for application. Applicants who are submitting an IELTS score must email their Test Report Form (TRF) number to mdsh@ucla.edu. The Admissions Team will then download and attach your official score report.

**Q**: Are international students in this program eligible for OPT?\
**A**: Yes.  Students also qualify for the [STEM OPT extension](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt).

**Q**: What are the entry requirements for international students?\
**A**: International students must meet the same requirements as domestic students.  In addition, you may be required to certify proficiency in English. [Learn more here.](https://grad.ucla.edu/admissions/english-requirements/#:~:text=Minimum%20IELTS%20%26%20TOEFL%20Scores&text=Your%20TOEFL%20score%20on%20the,as%20noted%20in%20Departmental%20Information.)

**Q**: Do international students need to obtain a score of 87 on TOEFL?\
**A**: If English is not your first language, and you do not hold a bachelor’s or higher degree from an Anglophone country, you will need to certify your proficiency in English by receiving the minimum overall band score or above on TOEFL or IELTS. This is a mandatory UCLA policy. [Learn more here.](https://grad.ucla.edu/admissions/english-requirements/#:~:text=Minimum%20IELTS%20%26%20TOEFL%20Scores&text=Your%20TOEFL%20score%20on%20the,as%20noted%20in%20Departmental%20Information.)

**Q**: Can I still apply for MDSH if my overall TOEFL score is above the minimum (87) but one of my individual section scores falls under the minimum?\
**A**: Yes, you are still eligible. The individual section score minimums found here are meant to give you an idea of what a typical strong candidate achieves in each section, however, these are not enforced requirements.

**Q**: Can the home edition of TOEFL be used when applying for this program?\
**A**: For applicants for Fall 2023 enrollment, yes.  For subsequent application cycles, TOEFL iBT Home Edition and IELTS Indicator test scores received prior to June 10, 2022 can count towards UCLA minimum admission requirements for graduate degree programs. Test scores for the TOEFL iBT or IELTS Indicator exam received beyond this date cannot be considered as alternatives to the TOEFL or IELTS Academic required to meet current English language requirements.

**Q**: What official documents do I need to send from my undergraduate institution?\
**A**: The documents required depends on your home country.  Please reach out to us if you are unsure what documents you need to provide in your application. For applicants graduating from Universities in China, the following documents are required: **Transcript, Degree Certificate, and Diploma**.  All three documents must be provided in **both Chinese and English**.  In your application, you may upload unofficial copies of these documents.  Once you are admitted, these documents must be sent directly by your University's Registrar Office or via Parchment to <admissions@ph.ucla.edu>.

### Academics and Student Life

**Q**: Is it possible to enroll in this program at the same time as another UCLA degree program?\
**A**: Taking two UCLA degree programs at the same time is called mixed enrollment. Because MDSH is a new degree program, it is not yet set up for this. We hope to allow mixed enrollment with MDSH in future years.  

**Q**: Can students enrolled in this program also take other non-MDSH courses at UCLA?\
**A**: MDSH students can take non-MDSH courses at UCLA. However, non-MDSH courses do not count towards the 48-unit requirement for the MDSH program and students will be charged extra tuition. 

**Q**: If I have a recent MPH degree from UCLA, can some of the classes be waived?\
**A**: The Public Heath C201 course can be waived if you got a degree from a [CEPH-accredited School of Public Health](https://ceph.org/about/org-info/who-we-accredit/accredited/). You have to take an extra MDSH elective to satisfy the 48-unit requirement of the MDSH program.  

**Q**: Upon degree completion, will the transcript or degree state that the program was completed in hybrid mode, or part-time?\
**A**: No.  Neither the transcript nor Degree will mention the hybrid course mode.  The MDSH program is considered a full-time program for F-1 Visa purposes, however, domestic students are welcome to take the program part-time. Transcripts will reflect each student's actual course enrollment per quarter. 

**Q**: Can MDSH students live in the University dormitories?\
**A**: Yes, although there may be a waiting list. Please contact the [UCLA Housing](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/) for more information. 

**Q**: What are the computer requirements for MDSH courses?\
**A**: For the MDSH coursework, computers with a minimum of 32GB RAM and 1 TB hard disk suffice.

### Finance 

**Q**: Are UCLA employees eligible for a discount on tuition?\
**A**: Since MDSH is a self-supporting graduate professional degree program, unfortunately, students are not eligible for employee discounts on tuition/fees.
