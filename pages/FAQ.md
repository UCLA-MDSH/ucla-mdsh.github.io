**A**: Graduate students taking at least 8 credit hours in Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters are considered full-time for visa reporting purposes. 

**Q**: Are international students in this program eligible for OPT?\

**Q**: What are the entry requirements for international students?\
**A**: International students must meet the same requirements as domestic students.  In addition, you may be required to certify proficiency in English.

**Q**: Do international students need to obtain a score of 87 on TOEFL?\
**A**: If English is not your first language, and you do not hold a bachelor’s or higher degree from an Anglophone country, you will need to certify your proficiency in English by receiving a score of 87 or above on TOEFL. This is a mandatory UCLA policy. [Learn more here.](https://grad.ucla.edu/admissions/english-requirements/#:~:text=Minimum%20IELTS%20%26%20TOEFL%20Scores&text=Your%20TOEFL%20score%20on%20the,as%20noted%20in%20Departmental%20Information.)

**Q**: Can the home edition of TOEFL be used when applying for this program?\
**A**: Any official score issued by TOEFL is acceptable.

### Academics and Student Life

**Q**: Is it possible to enroll in this program at the same as another UCLA degree program?\
**A**: Taking two UCLA degree programs at the same time is called mixed enrollment. Because MDSH is a new degree program, it is not yet set up for this. We hope to allow mixed enrollment with MDSH in the 2024-2025 academic year.

**Q**: Can students enrolled in this program also take other non-MDSH courses at UCLA?\
**A**: As of the 2023-2024 academic year, no.  We hope to expand MDSH students' eligibility for other courses in the future. 

**Q**: If I have a recent MPH degree from UCLA, can some of the classes be waived?\
**A**: At the moment, no. In the future, we hope to allow mixed enrollment with the MDSH, which may allow for waiving certain classes. 

**Q**: Can MDSH students live in the University dormitories?\
**A**: Yes, although there may be a waiting list.
