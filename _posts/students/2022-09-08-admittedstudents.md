## UCLA Logon ID

To create your UCLA Logon ID go to <https://accounts.iam.ucla.edu/#/>.

## Student ID (BruinCard)

To access the building on Saturday and Sunday you will need a BruinCard. It is best to [apply online](https://secure.bruincard.ucla.edu/bcw/web/Home.aspx) and submit your photo no later than August 31st, 2024 to ensure it is ready by orientation. Once you submit your photo, you will receive two emails, one indicating that your picture was received, and another email indicating whether your photo was approved or not. Please disregard the second email's message about coming to the office to pick up your card. The MDSH program will pick up your BruinCard and have it available for you at the program orientation. Please complete this [authorization form](https://www.mphhp.ph.ucla.edu/s/Third-Party-Pick-Up-Authorization-Form.pdf) and email it to our Student Affairs Officer Chandler Eldridge at <celdridge@ph.ucla.edu>.

## Title IX Training

Every UC graduate and professional student is required to complete sexual assault prevention training(s) each academic year as follows:
* Each first-year graduate and professional student will be required to complete a 1-hour online training, from Vector LMS.
* Each continuing graduate and professional student will only be required to complete a 1-hour online refresher training, from Vector LMS.


## Vaccinations

Students are required to show proof of immunity against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella (Chicken Pox), Tdap (pertussis) and Meningitis ACYW (for those under the age of 21) and complete a screening questionnaire for Tuberculosis (TB).

* The University of California allows for exemptions to these immunization requirements **based only on a medical condition that is a contraindication to a vaccination.** (See [Medical Exception Request](https://immunizationrequirement.ucla.edu/exceptions/medical-exceptions))
* Covered individuals are required to submit documentation of either a COVID-19 vaccine or opt out by declining the vaccine on the [Ashe Center Patient Portal](https://www.studenthealth.ucla.edu/portal)

If you fail to complete these requirements by the first day of fall quarter, an enrollment hold will be placed and you will not be able to add/drop or register for classes.
